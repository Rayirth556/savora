# 💸 Savora — Gamified Financial Literacy for Young Indians

**Savora** is an educational app designed to make **financial literacy practical, engaging, and rewarding** for young Indians (teens to early 20s).  
Through realistic simulations, interactive games, and a safe, controlled virtual wallet, Savora helps users build money habits that stick — **before they handle real money.**

## 📌 What is Savora?

Savora combines two main parts:

### 🕹️ 1. Gamified Financial Education

Savora turns key personal finance lessons into **interactive mini-games and scenario-based challenges**:
- Learn **budgeting, investing, saving discipline, risk management**, and more.
- Play with a **virtual stock market simulator** to understand how real investments behave.
- Navigate a **Life Finance Simulator** where choices mimic real adult money decisions — like loans vs. savings, emergencies, insurance, and big purchases.
- Make smart choices to earn XP, level up, and unlock more advanced content.

### 💼 2. Simulated Wallet & Spending Practice

Savora includes a **mock digital wallet**, similar to real UPI apps:
- Users get virtual currency to practice transactions in a **safe sandbox**.
- Perform mock UPI-style payments.
- Track spending with categories like **Needs, Wants, and Regrets**.
- Every spending decision affects XP: good habits get rewarded, poor choices cost points.
- Higher levels unlock features like simulated **interest bonuses, advanced budgeting, and saving tools**.
