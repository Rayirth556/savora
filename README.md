# Savora — A Gamified Financial Literacy Platform for Young Indians

Savora is an experimental mobile application designed to help India’s youth (teenagers to young adults) understand and practice real-world personal finance through gamification, realistic simulations, and behavior-based progression.

## Why Savora?

India faces a major financial literacy gap among students and early working professionals. Concepts like budgeting, investing, risk management, credit discipline, and long-term planning are rarely taught in school. Savora addresses this gap by transforming financial education into an interactive experience, encouraging users to build good money habits that carry over into real life.

## Core Features

### 1. Gamified Financial Education

- **Mini-Games and Interactive Scenarios:** Users learn core financial principles such as budgeting, savings discipline, investing basics, loans, and insurance through short, interactive scenarios that simulate real decision-making.
- **Life Finance Simulator:** The app includes a decision-based life simulation where users navigate scenarios like handling unexpected expenses, choosing between EMIs and saving up, or picking insurance plans, all while tracking their outcomes.
- **Stock Market Simulator:** Savora offers a stock market sandbox powered by real historical data (up to 2024) to comply with regulatory boundaries while providing a practical environment for users to understand market behavior, volatility, diversification, and portfolio strategies.
- **Progression and Rewards:** As users make sound financial decisions, they earn experience points (XP), maintain streaks, and level up. Higher levels unlock advanced modules, tools, and simulations, creating an incentive structure for continuous learning.

### 2. Simulated Wallet and Spending Behavior

- **Mock Wallet:** Users receive a simulated digital wallet with a balance of virtual money. They can practice mock UPI-style payments, categorize spending into needs, wants, and regrets, and analyze patterns.
- **Behavior-Linked Rewards:** Each transaction impacts the user’s XP, encouraging healthy spending and saving behaviors. Responsible choices are rewarded with simulated interest bonuses and access to advanced financial tools within the app.
- **Future Integration:** While the MVP is fully offline-first with no real money transactions, the roadmap includes integration with regulated UPI providers (e.g., Razorpay, Setu) and potential partnerships with NBFCs to transition Savora into a real fintech tool that blends financial learning with genuine financial empowerment.

## Long-Term Vision

Savora is not just another finance app. The goal is to become an **officially certified financial literacy platform**. We plan to collaborate with established financial institutions like Bajaj Finance and other regulated bodies to ensure the content meets educational standards and delivers practical, responsible guidance to users.

## Current Status

- **Tech Stack:** Flutter (cross-platform), mock integrations, offline-first architecture for hackathon MVP.
- **Team:** 4 members focused on product design, frontend development, game mechanics, and future backend integrations.
- **Development Stage:** Core features are built for demo and pilot testing. Roadmap includes production-grade wallet simulations, real-world data integrations, regulatory compliance, and official partnerships.
